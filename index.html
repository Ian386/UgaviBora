    <h1>Farm2Fork</h1>
    <div>
        <p>Globally and especially in East Africa, agricultural supply chains, small-scale farmers, agro-dealers, and
            urban retailers face significant challenges in ensuring the efficient, sustainable distribution of food
            products. Consumers increasingly demand to know the origins of their food, and retailers require precise
            information to manage inventory and meet consumer demand. Inefficiencies in the agricultural supply chain
            lead to high post-harvest losses, inconsistent quality and availability of produce, and inflated prices due
            to multiple layers of intermediaries. These issues compromise farming's economic viability, restrict
            consumer access to fresh produce, and hinder fair value distribution. Despite growing demands for
            transparency and efficiency, existing solutions lack comprehensive integration for all stakeholders,
            including farmers, agro-dealers, retailers, and logistics providers. There is a critical need for a
            transformative platform that seamlessly connects these stakeholders, prioritizing efficiency,
            sustainability, and profitability throughout the supply chain.</p>
